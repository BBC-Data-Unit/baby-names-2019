In August 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49420311) on the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data on baby name popularity: Arthur entered the top 10 for boys for the first time since the 1920s, with Ada in the top 100 girls' names for the first time in a century. The ONS said girls named Alexa also halved in a year, possibly due to potential confusion with Amazon's Echo.
