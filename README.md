In August 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49420311) on the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data on baby name popularity, including an interactive lookup. 

We combined the data for the past two years with the historical data from 1996 to 2016 to show the trends in certain names, including those with the sharpest increases and decreases in the past 10 years. Arthur has seen the biggest upward curve, which the ONS puts down to the popularity of Peaky Blinders.

The story saw the first use of a [sparkline chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) by the data team, generated using R's `ggplot` package.
